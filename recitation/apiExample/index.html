            <strong>What your extension is:</strong>
            My extension uses the "Show Author" button as a "reveal" feature. The page loads a new quote but hides the author, prompting the user to guess before clicking the button to see the answer.

            <strong>How you could imagine using an API in your critique project:</strong>
            For my media aesthetics critique project, I could use an API to enhance my analysis. For example, if I were critiquing a film, I could use The Movie Database (TMDb) API. I would use it to dynamically pull the film's official poster, director, release year, and cast, and display this structured data alongside my written critique, making the project more interactive and data-rich.
