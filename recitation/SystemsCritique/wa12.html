		<h1>"fairer" Local Shows Finder</h1>
		<p>ATLS2200 Systems Critique Project</p>
		<p>Big event ticket vendors use algorithms that suggest more profitable tickets. My site recognizes this problem and offers fairer alternatives. Admittedly, my implementattion isn't that good but the idea is there lol</p>
		<p>Note: Ticketmaster often doesn't include pricing info in their API... even though they show it on their own site, so unfortunately thats why many events here don't display prices.</p>

		<div id="controls">
			<input id="cityInput" type="text" placeholder="Enter a city" />

			<button id="fairBtn" type="button">Fair Search (local & cheap)</button>
